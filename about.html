                    <h1>Hey! If you have a question about who she is.</h1>
                    <p>She is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_chakraborty.smriti_/" target='_blank'>Smriti Chakraborty!</a> </p>
                    <p>I can go on and on about her for the whole day. But I won't do that because I know that you won't believe that such a person exists, in real life also(not only in dreams and heaven).
                    </p>
                    <p>She is Good in studies and very agile and very very very Cute.</p>
                    <p>But, to only say that is an insult to her. As she is a lot of things.
                    </p>
                    <p>She is a musical Parody, a brilliant singer! My God, sometimes her singing gives me Goosebumps.</p>
